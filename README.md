# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repository contains assignments and projects I've done both for school and for my own education. I am interested in applying data science and machine learning techniques to life sciences problems, so you will find that my projects are mostly related to biology, or some other field of science. Science is actually really hard, so I decided my next challenge is to learn to make supercomputers do it.

* **Numerical Analysis: Hypersonic Flow Modeling**: 
* * Here are several algorithms I wrote to compute the QR factorization of square matrices and solve Ax=b. 
* * Also included are sparsity-inducing algorithms and their use in regression models applied to underdetermined systems.

* **Astro Data Mining**:  Mining pulsar radiofrequency signals using PySpark and the Bridges2 Supercomputer.


* **Comparing Human and Elephant p53 Genes**: Comparing and contrasting the Human and Elephant P53 genes.


* **Linear Models and RNA-Seq Data**: Classification of RNA seq data using linear models.
* **PCA and Clustering with Spark**: Using Spark and Bridges2 to discover features and structures of 6-dimensional data
* **Predicting GFP Brightness**: Engineering features to classify GFP mutants as "high brightness" or "low brightness".
