# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repository contains assignments and projects I've done both for school and for my own education. I am interested in applying data science and machine learning techniques to life sciences problems, so you will find that my projects are mostly related to biology, or some other field of science.....and pokemon. Science is actually really hard, so I figured it would be worthwile to learn to make supercomputers do it.

* **Astro Data Mining**:  Mining pulsar radiofrequency signals using PySpark and the Bridges2 Supercomputer.


* **Comparing Human and Elephant p53 Genes**: Comparing and contrasting the Human and Elephant P53 genes.


* **Linear Models and RNA-Seq Data**: Classification of RNA seq data using linear models.
* **PCA and Clustering with Spark**: Using Spark and Bridges2 to discover features and structures of 6-dimensional data
* **Predicting GFP Brightness**: Engineering features to classify GFP mutants as "high brightness" or "low brightness".
* **poke.py**:
* * A fun way to level up my Python skills and learn object oriented programming. I create a Pokemon class, where each pokemon can battle and heal. This is a work in progress: only three pokemon so far, each only has one move, etc. Because I know too much about Pokemon, I know several features I plan to add to the project over time (like a full set of four moves, dual types, stats, items, etc.).
