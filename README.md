# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repository contains assignments and projects I've done both for school and for my own education. I am interested in applying data science and machine learning techniques to life sciences problems, so you will find that my projects are mostly related to biology, or some other field of science.

* Astro Data Mining
* * In this mini-project, I explore and analyze pulsar data using Apache Spark/PySpark on the Bridges2 supercomputer. The goal is to find the most regular temporarily repeating radiofrequency source. With the completion of this project, I developed skill with Apache spark and aquired the skills necessary to effectively explore and analyze large scale data sets.


* Comparing Human and Elephant p53 Genes
* * In this project, I analyze DNA sequences for the gene p53, which is used to suppress cancer in organisms. Specifically, I compare the p53 genes in humans and elephants, to identify what they have in common and how they are different.To do this, I interpret DNA data files from the NIH, convert them to RNA, then convert that to a sequence of generated proteins. Next, I compare the protein sequences of the two different genes, automatically generate text reports of your findings, and graph the results, which are displayed at the bottom of this notebook.


* Linear Models and RNA-Seq Data
* * In this project, I use linear models to predict the disease type from a data set containing the expression levels of 17,970 genes. The disease of interest here is Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC), which is the result of uncontrollable growth of cells that line the uterus. The output labels are binary (1, 0) where 1 encodes the tumor grade II- and 0 encodes the tumor grade III+.
