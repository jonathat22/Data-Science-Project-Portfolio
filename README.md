# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repository contains assignments and projects I've done both for school and for my own education. I am interested in applying data science and machine learning techniques to life sciences problems, so you will find that my projects are mostly related to biology, or some other field of science.

* Astro Data Mining
* * In this mini-project, I explore and analyze pulsar data using Apache Spark/PySpark on the Bridges2 supercomputer. The goal is to find the most regular temporarily repeating radiofrequency source. With the completion of this project, I developed skill with Apache spark and aquired the skills necessary to effectively explore and analyze large scale data sets.
