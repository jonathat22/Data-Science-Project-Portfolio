# Data Science Project Portfolio by Jonathan Taylor

This repository contains assignments and projects I've done both for school and for my own education. I am interested in applying data science and machine learning techniques to life sciences problems, so you will find that my projects are mostly related to biology, or some other field of science.

* **Numerical Analysis: Hypersonic Flow Modeling**: 
  * Here are several algorithms I wrote to compute the QR factorization of square matrices and solve Ax=b. 
  * Also included are sparsity-inducing algorithms and their use in regression models applied to underdetermined systems.

* **protein_sequencing**: Comparing and contrasting the Human and Elephant P53 genes.
  * Included in these files are the human and elephant p53 gene sequences, and python scripts containing my code and test functions, respectively. I unit tested each of my functions using pytest.
  * The jupyter notebook contains the same python code, plus explanations of each step written in markdown. The code is organized by cell such that the execution of the code can be followed through to the output.

* **Astro Data Mining**:  Mining pulsar radiofrequency signals using PySpark and the Bridges2 Supercomputer.


* **Linear Models and RNA-Seq Data**: Classification of RNA seq data using linear models.
* **PCA and Clustering with Spark**: Using Spark and Bridges2 to discover features and structures of 6-dimensional data
* **Predicting GFP Brightness**: Engineering features to classify GFP mutants as "high brightness" or "low brightness".

* **Statistical Analysis Predicting Civil Wars using R**: https://www.stat.cmu.edu/capstoneresearch/600files/poster1.pdf
*  **UNET for Image Segmentation**: Image segmentation is an important problem in computer vision and has potential applications if biology and medical image analysis. In this notebook, I implement the U-net architecture and apply it to a dataset containing cell nuclei.
