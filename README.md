# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repository contains assignments and projects I've done both for school and for my own education. I am interested in applying data science and machine learning techniques to life sciences problems, so you will find that my projects are mostly related to biology, or some other field of science.

* **Astro Data Mining**:  Mining pulsar radiofrequency signals using PySpark.


* **Comparing Human and Elephant p53 Genes**: Comparing and contrasting the Human and Elephant P53 genes.


* **Linear Models and RNA-Seq Data**: Classification of RNA seq data using linear models.
